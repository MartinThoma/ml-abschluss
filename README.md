This is a 10 - 15 minutes presentation for a machine learning lab group.
We worked on pixel-wise street segmentation.

It will be at Wednesday, the 24. July 2015 in FZI.

This one doesn't compile, as you need the KIT-Style (logos, layout,

Please take a look at the presentation "Tutorenschulung" for further
